## Context Pooling: Novel Query-specific Graph Pooling to Identify Logically Relevant Neighbors for Inductive Link Prediction in Knowledge Graphs

This is the repository for IJCAI anonymous submission **Context Pooling: Novel Query-specific Graph Pooling to Identify Logically Relevant Neighbors for Inductive Link Prediction in Knowledge Graphs**.

In this paper, we introduce a novel method, named Context Pooling, to enhance GNN-based models' efficacy for link predictions in KGs. To our best of knowledge, Context Pooling is the first methodology that applies graph pooling in KGs. 
Additionally, Context Pooling is first-of-its-kind to enable the generation of query-specific graphs for inductive settings, where testing entities are unseen during training.
